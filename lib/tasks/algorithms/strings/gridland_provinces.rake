# The Kingdom of Gridland contains P provinces. Each province is defined as a 2xN grid where each cell in the grid represents
# a city. Every cell in the grid contains a single lowercase character denoting the first character of the city name
# corresponding to that cell.
#
# From a city with the coordinates (i,j), it is possible to move to any of the following cells in 1 unit of time
# (provided that the destination cell is within the confines of the grid):
#
#     ( i-1, j )
#     ( i+1, j )
#     ( i, j-1 )
#     ( i, j+1 )
#
#
# A knight wants to visit all the cities in Gridland. He can start his journey in any city and immediately stops his
# journey after having visited each city at least once. Moreover, he always plans his journey in such a way that the
# total time required to complete it is minimum.
#
# After completing his tour of each province, the knight forms a string by concatenating the characters of all the
# cells in his path. How many distinct strings can he form in each province?
#
#
#  [Input Format]
#
# The first line contains a single integer, P, denoting the number of provinces. The 3*P subsequent lines describe
# each province over the following three lines:
#
#     The first line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of columns in the province.
#     Each of the next two lines contains a string, S, of length N denoting the characters for
#     the first and second row of the province.
#
#  [Constraints]
#
#     1 <= P <= 15
#     1 <= N <= 600
#     Si âˆˆ {a-z}
#
#
# [Output Format]
#
# For each province, print the number of distinct strings the knight can form on a new line.
#
#
# [Sample Input]
#
#   3       (P)
#   1       (N)

#   a       (P1 cities of length N)
#   a       (P1 cities of length N)
